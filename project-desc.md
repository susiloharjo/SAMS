SAMS: Smart Asset Management System


Project Overview
SAMS is a comprehensive web-based Asset Management System designed to manage the tracking, organization, and querying of various assets, including fixed assets (e.g., IT equipment, vehicles, machinery) and non-fixed assets (e.g., land, buildings). The system supports asset creation, QR code/barcode generation, lifecycle management, location and ownership tracking, maintenance scheduling, document management, reporting, role-based access control (RBAC), audit trails for compliance, and an AI-powered assistant for natural language queries, recommendations, and report summarization. It is built to be secure, scalable, and user-friendly, with mobile support for QR/barcode scanning and compliance with standards like ISO and SOX.
Key Features

Asset Registry (Master Data Aset):

Centralized registry for all assets (IT, machinery, vehicles, buildings, land, etc.).
Comprehensive data: Asset ID, category, status (active, damaged, disposed), value, acquisition date, economic life, and custom fields.
Bulk import/export via CSV/Excel with validation for data integrity.


QR Code / Barcode Integration:

Generate unique QR codes/barcodes for each asset, encoding Asset ID and basic info.
Mobile/web scanning (via browser camera or app) to access asset details instantly.
Exportable labels (PDF) using libraries like qrcode and go-barcode.


Lifecycle Management:

Track assets from acquisition to disposal, including depreciation (straight-line, declining balance).
Log lifecycle events (e.g., usage, transfers, disposal approvals) with timestamps.


Location & Ownership Tracking:

Hierarchical location management (e.g., country > city > building > room) with GPS integration (Google Maps API for land/buildings).
Assign assets to users or departments; track transfers with history.
Visualize locations on maps or lists.


Maintenance Management:

Schedule preventive/corrective maintenance with calendar integration.
Automated reminders (email/SMS) for due/overdue tasks.
Log maintenance history, costs, and outcomes.


Document Management:

Store asset-related documents (e.g., certificates, invoices, warranties, photos).
Version control with update history; secure storage with access controls.
Searchable document repository linked to assets.


Reporting & Analytics:

Dashboard for asset conditions (active, damaged, needs maintenance).
Reports: Depreciation, book value, maintenance costs, inventory summaries.
Export to PDF/Excel/CSV with customizable templates.


User & Role Management (RBAC):

Roles: Admin (full access), Manager (edit/approve), Staff (limited), Auditor (read-only).
Granular permissions for modules and assets.
JWT-based authentication with optional multi-factor support.


Audit Trail & Compliance:

Log all user actions (who, what, when) for audit trails.
Support for ISO/SOX compliance with exportable logs and immutable records.
Filterable/searchable logs for audits.


AI Assistant / Smart Search:

Natural language queries (e.g., "Show IT assets with expired warranties" or "Summarize maintenance costs for 2025").
AI-powered recommendations (e.g., maintenance schedules based on usage history).
Report summarization using LangChain and Gemini for processing queries against asset data.
Vector search with Qdrant for efficient similarity-based retrieval of assets/documents.


Additional Capabilities:

Real-time updates and notifications across modules.
Mobile responsiveness for scanning and access.
RESTful API for third-party integrations (e.g., ERP, accounting).
Global search across assets, documents, and logs.



Technology Stack

Frontend: Next.js (React) with Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI. Use Zustand or React Query for state management.
Backend: Go (Golang) with Fiber or Echo for fast, lightweight RESTful APIs. JWT for authentication.
Database: PostgreSQL for relational data (assets, users, logs) with structured schemas.
Vector Database: Qdrant for vector-based search to support AI-driven queries and recommendations.
AI Integration: Google Gemini API for natural language processing, integrated via LangChain for chaining queries and context management.
QR/Barcode: go-qrcode and go-barcode libraries for generation.
Document Storage: Cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3 or MinIO) for secure file handling.
Containerization: Docker for development, testing, and deployment.
Other Libraries/Tools:

GORM for PostgreSQL ORM.
Google Maps API for location visualization.
go-mail or similar for email notifications.
gofpdf or wkhtmltopdf for PDF report generation; excelize for Excel exports.
FullCalendar (frontend) for maintenance scheduling.


Testing: Go test for backend unit tests, Playwright for end-to-end frontend testing.
Security: HTTPS, input sanitization, RBAC, encryption for sensitive data (e.g., documents).

Architecture

Microservices Approach: Modular services (e.g., asset-service, auth-service, ai-service, document-service) for scalability, managed with Docker Compose.
Data Flow:

Frontend (Next.js) → API calls to Go backend → PostgreSQL for structured data, Qdrant for vector search.
AI queries: Frontend sends request → Backend processes with LangChain + Gemini → Qdrant/PostgreSQL for data retrieval → Formatted response.
Documents: Upload to cloud storage, metadata in PostgreSQL.


Deployment: Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes (optional) or Docker Swarm, hosted on AWS, GCP, or Vercel for frontend.

Development Plan

Setup: Initialize Next.js with Tailwind CSS and Go backend with Fiber/Echo. Set up Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, Qdrant, and MinIO.
Database Schema: Define PostgreSQL tables for Asset, User, Location, Maintenance, Document, AuditLog. Configure Qdrant for vector storage.
Core Features: Implement asset registry, QR/barcode generation, lifecycle, location/ownership tracking.
Advanced Modules: Add maintenance, document management, RBAC, audit trails.
AI Integration: Set up LangChain with Gemini for queries, recommendations, and summarizations; index asset data in Qdrant.
Frontend: Build responsive dashboard, forms, and AI chat interface with Tailwind CSS.
Testing & Polish: Add notifications, compliance features, and optimize performance.
Deployment: Deploy frontend to Vercel, backend/services to AWS/GCP with Docker.
