# SAMS Project - Active Context

## Current Phase: PLAN (MVP Planning)
**Date**: MVP Planning
**Focus**: Detailed implementation planning for 1-week MVP development

## Project Context
- **Project Name**: SAMS (Smart Asset Management System)
- **Complexity Level**: 2-3 (Moderate to High - Focused MVP)
- **Scope**: 1-Week MVP with core asset management features
- **Timeline**: Aggressive 1-week development for government/client demo
- **Team**: Single developer (can scale to team post-MVP)

## Current Objectives
1. ‚úÖ Complete Memory Bank system setup
2. ‚úÖ Initialize project structure and MVP scope
3. üîÑ Create detailed MVP implementation plan
4. ‚è≥ Begin rapid development for 1-week timeline

## Technical Context (MVP)
- **Architecture**: Single backend service (simplified for speed)
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS (rapid development)
- **Backend**: Go (Golang) + simple REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (single database, simplified schema)
- **Maps**: Google Maps API for geotagging and location display
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (direct integration, no complex LangChain)
- **QR**: Basic QR generation library
- **Infrastructure**: Docker for development

## Key Decisions Made
- **Scope Adjustment**: Changed from enterprise system to focused MVP
- **Timeline**: 1-week aggressive development schedule
- **Complexity**: Reduced from Level 4 to Level 2-3
- **Workflow**: Simplified to VAN ‚Üí PLAN ‚Üí IMPLEMENT ‚Üí REFLECT ‚Üí ARCHIVE
- **Architecture**: Single service approach for MVP speed

## MVP Features Priority
1. **Asset CRUD** - ISO 55001 compliant asset management
2. **Dynamic Categories** - User-defined asset categories
3. **Location Management** - Map integration with geotagging
4. **QR Code Generation** - Asset identification and tagging
5. **LLM Integration** - AI queries for asset information
6. **Demo Data** - Government buildings, IT equipment, vehicles

## Next Phase Preparation
- **Target Mode**: IMPLEMENT
- **Focus Areas**: 
  - Rapid MVP development
  - Core feature implementation
  - Demo preparation
  - Government/client presentation

## Current Blockers
None identified - ready to proceed with MVP planning.

## Notes
- Project scope adjusted for 1-week MVP timeline
- Focus on core features for government/client demo
- Simplified architecture for rapid development
- ISO 55001 compliance maintained for professional credibility
