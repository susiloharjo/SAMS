- ✅ **Navigation**: Responsive sidebar with Department link

### **Database & Services**
- ✅ **PostgreSQL**: 6 departments, 20+ dummy assets
- ✅ **Redis**: Caching service running
- ✅ **MCP Server**: Python FastAPI server with all tools
- ✅ **Docker**: All services containerized and running

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Department Query Logic**
```go
// PRIORITY 2.5: Department-specific queries
if strings.Contains(lowerMessage, "department") || strings.Contains(lowerMessage, "departement") ||
    strings.Contains(lowerMessage, "dept") || strings.Contains(lowerMessage, "by department") {
    
    // Extract actual department name from query
    departmentName := extractDepartmentName(lowerMessage)
    
    return "get_assets_by_department", map[string]interface{}{
        "department": departmentName, 
        "limit": 20
    }
}
```

### **MCP Tool Integration**
- **Tool Selection**: Backend determines appropriate MCP tool
- **Parameter Extraction**: Smart parameter mapping from user queries
- **Result Processing**: Gemini AI uses MCP tool results as knowledge source
- **Response Generation**: Professional, accurate responses based on tool data

## Next Steps (Optional)

### **Potential Enhancements**
1. **Asset Creation**: Add more dummy assets to test department queries
2. **Advanced Queries**: Implement complex multi-parameter searches
3. **Performance**: Add caching for frequently requested data
4. **Analytics**: Dashboard improvements for department-based insights

### **Current Capabilities**
- ✅ **Asset Queries**: By name, category, status, location, department
- ✅ **Department Management**: Full CRUD operations
- ✅ **Category Management**: Asset categorization system
- ✅ **Location Tracking**: Interactive map integration
- ✅ **QR Code System**: Individual and bulk generation
- ✅ **AI Assistant**: Natural language asset queries
- ✅ **User Management**: Role-based access control

## System Health
